#  TypeScript 

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of **TypeScript** by defining interfaces, working with basic types, manipulating the **DOM**, and compiling with **Webpack** for browser execution.

- Manipulate the **DOM** safely using TypeScript
- Work with **generic types**
- Organize code using **namespaces**
- **Merge declarations** effectively
- Use an **ambient namespace** to import and type external libraries
- Apply **nominal typing** principles in TypeScript
